Firmware and Driver for Renesas USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller Lenovo Thinkpad P14s AMD Gen-1

This is a firmware needed for the missing P14s USB3.0 Renesas chip. Without this firmware, your webcam will not be detected and function.
Lenovo somehow screwed up the BIOS updates and missed out on this firmware somewhere from v1.17 onwards, so you will need this firmware for Windows
